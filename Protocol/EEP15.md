#Abstract

 I was thinking this week about defining a governance/administration standard for contracts and modules in ethereum nodes. 
 That be a standard interface that shared contract systems could implement allowing them to be administered by an administration dApp on Ethereum that allowed multiple parties to vote on updates to their shared systems.

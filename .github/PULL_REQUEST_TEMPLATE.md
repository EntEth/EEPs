## EEP Pull Request Submission

Thank you for contributing! Please take a moment to review our [**contributing guidelines**](https://github.com/EntEth/EEPs/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)

- [ ] Documentation is updated (if necessary)

Be kind to code reviewers, please try to keep EEP pull requests as small and focused as possible :)

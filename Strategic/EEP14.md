#Abstract

We are testing the fund EEP.
Russell sent 2 ropsten ether to the Board: https://ropsten.io/tx/0xe9753ba4a12bedf2deca04991b4afb4f37d7828637eaf6a54e6017c6f13de647
So now we are going to try and send 1 back to him.
We are not sure if we need to add an explicity proxy contract for this to work.
